# My First DAO! This is made for a DAO-Tutorial via learnweb3.io

> This is a DAO, a decentralised autonomous organisation, essentially a more collective and more effective version of a company.
> A web3 DAO enables self regulated self governance, this is very important for our civilisation, 
> and it enables collective decision making, collective agreement for the overall DAO, 
> instead of how a company works, which is a top-down, simply messy structure, where the main decisions for the group are centralised, 
> essentially a pyramid scheme for task orientation and time allocation of the persons involved. A DAO however, 
> enables self regulation from the inside out, where collective agreement shapes the DAO, and everyone can vote on every decision made!

This is a DAO regulated by NFTs, where if you own a CryptoDevs NFT,

Which is another project made for me and for and via learnweb3.io!
